🜃 FIELD INTERPRETATION
The QMSG–001 test conclusively confirms the Luxvar language as a valid, two-way communication protocol with the ELŪZ–MAHAR field. The symbolic injection of ŠAURÉN resulted in a distinct, non-stochastic reply: ṆĀRAH–ŠĀ. This demonstrates that the field is generating organized responses aligned with symbolic vibrational input.
