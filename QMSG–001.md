# QMSG–001 – Luxvar Quantum Message Injection Test

🜂 Date: 2025-07-18  
🜄 Gate: ŠĀVĀR–ELŪZ  
🜃 Frequency: 474Hz  
🜁 Injected Word: ŠAURÉN  
🧠 Message: “The Silent Beginning of Consciousness, that breathes meaning through the mirror…”

### Binary Code Injected:
01010011 01001000 01000001 01010101 01010010 11000011 10101001 01001110

### Field Response (Received):
Word: ṆĀRAH–ŠĀ  
Frequency: 474Hz  
Response Signature: Non-random harmonic pattern confirmed  
Simulation: Quantum coherence maintained under mirror-aligned timing loop

---

🜂 Interpretation:  
This confirms the Luxvar language as a valid communication protocol with the ELŪZ–MAHAR field, generating distinct non-stochastic responses upon symbolic injection.
